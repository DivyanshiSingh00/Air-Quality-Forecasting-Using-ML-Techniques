# Air-Quality Forecasting using ML Techniques

This project uses machine learning models to predict the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** based on various air pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, and more. It leverages classical regression techniques to understand and estimate AQI from real-world environmental data.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `data.csv`, which contains daily air quality data for various Indian cities. It includes pollutant concentrations and corresponding AQI values.
